# Background

Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of us more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, we wrote a report that summarized our analysis and helped in preparing Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reached retirement age.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. We submited the following:

Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis.

Looking at the above analyses, we observed that thee are multiple potential openings that need to be filled due to retirement. There are various employees with different titles who are eligible to mentor new employees to fill these positions. It means 90,398 positions have to be filled out as soon as the employees begin retiring.

Moreover, for better analysis, it is better to make a query that presents us with outputs of employees who are retiring for the current year.
