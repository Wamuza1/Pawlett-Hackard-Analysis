# Background

Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of us more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, we wrote a report that summarized our analysis and helped in preparing Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reached retirement age.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. We submited the following:

Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
